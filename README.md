# vgcollect-to-pricecharting
Script to parse a VGCollect export and format it to be exported to PriceCharting

This was a quick and dirty script to build out a series of strings to use as import input in PriceCharting. The code here is not optimized or ideal, and is not really built for extended use outside of my own use case. Feel free to use it for yourself though!
